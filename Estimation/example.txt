### Unadjusted Use Case Weight (UUCW)
Simple 1 to 3 transactions Weight 5
Average 4 to 7 transactions Weight 10
Simple 8 or more transactions Weight 15

### Environmental Complexity Factor (ECF)
between 0 (no experience) and 5 (expert) to each of the 8 environmental factors listed in the table below
```
ECF = 1.4 + (-0.03 x EF)
```

Factor|Description|Weight

E1	Familiarity with development process used	1.5

E2	Application experience	0.5

E3	Object-oriented experience of team	1.0

E4	Lead analyst capability	0.5

E5	Motivation of the team	1.0

E6	Stability of requirements	2.0

E7	Part-time staff	-1.0

E8	Difficult programming language	-1.0

Use Case Points (UCP)

UCP = (UUCW + UAW) x TCF x ECF

UUCW = (2 x 5) + (3 x 10) + (4 x 15) = 100
